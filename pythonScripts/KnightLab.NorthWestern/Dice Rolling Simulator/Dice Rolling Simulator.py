# 1. Dice Rolling Simulator

# The Goal: Like the title suggests, this project involves writing a program that simulates rolling dice.
# When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6.
# (Or whatever other integer you prefer — the number of sides on the die is up to you.)
# The program will print what that number is. It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again.
# For this project, you’ll need to set the min and max number that your dice can produce.
# For the average die, that means a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6.
# You’ll also want a function that randomly grabs a number within that range and prints it.

# Concepts to keep in mind:

# Random
# Integer
# Print
# While Loops


# A good project for beginners, this project will help establish a solid foundation for basic concepts.
# And if you already have programming experience,
# chances are that the concepts used in this project aren’t completely foreign to you.
# Print, for example, is similar to Javascript’s console.log.

    answer = input("Enter 'Stop' if you would like to stop, otherwise press 'Enter'. ")
    if answer == "Stop":
        break
